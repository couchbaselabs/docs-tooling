= Filenames

When naming a new file, use dashes to separate words. 

Use lowercase letters for all characters in a filename. Make sure that at least the first character in a filename is in lowercase. 

Use capital letters where it makes sense to do so, such as specifying an acronym in a filename. 

All topic files should use the `.adoc` file extension.

For example: 

* `indexes.adoc`
* `creating-buckets.adoc`
* `run-N1QL-queries.adoc`

CAUTION: Don't retroactively change filenames for published topics. This causes tooling issues and means that we have to create and maintain more redirects.
