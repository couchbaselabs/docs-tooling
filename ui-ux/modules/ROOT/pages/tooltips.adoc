= Tooltips 

A tooltip appears when a user points to something in the UI, but doesn't click. 

A tooltip can come in two styles: 

. They can provide information about an unlabelled icon. 
. They can provide additional information or instruction: 
.. Text that was too long to fit in the UI. 
.. A link to documentation for further reading or instructions. 

== Don't Overuse Tooltips 

Too many tooltips can cause a user to ignore them or become "blind" to them in the UI. 

Don't use a tooltip just to keep instruction text off of the screen. 

== Keep to Critical Information 

Keep tooltips as short as possible and only include the most critical information. 

If you need to, include a link for the user so they can read and learn more.
